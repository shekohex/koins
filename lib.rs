//! ## Koins (\ËˆkÈ¯in\) ðŸª™
//!
//! Koins is a smart-contract built as an experiment to see how we could build a simple and secure
//! points system for current applications we have today.
//!
//! for example, imagine that we have an application where users own coins
//! and they can do things inside the application using these points/coins like buying in-app items
//! or transferring these Coins between them ...etc.
//! and they can obtain these Coins by purchasing them from the system in **fiat currencies**.
//!
//! To build such a system we need a lot of security concerns like how do we secure our database?
//! how do we ensure that no one will play sneaky and modify the coins for a specific account
//! in our database? maybe it is not you, but someone else in your team could do so!
//!
//! This idea of storing your payments on a blockchain sounds very good!
//! but nor you or your team has the time or the experience to build, manage, and lunch your own chain!
//! it is not hard, to be honest with you with `Substrate` now, but it costs a lot in the real world
//! to manage and update the chain and to keep it going/working.
//!
//! ### The Idea ðŸ’¡
//!
//! The idea behind this contract is to simply I asked myself, could we have a way to utilize
//! blockchain more in our current app implementations? I'm not referring here to `dApps`
//! but I'm pointing to an application that is centralized in one way or in another.
//!
//! This Smart Contract ensures everything that gets preserved is 100% correct.
//! it is very simple only 2 methods (if we didn't count increment or decrement)
//! few lines of code, and with everything documented.
//!
//! ### Current use-case
//!
//! I'm currently building `Owlchat` in my free time and at the weekends,
//! and for anyone who does not know about `Owlchat`, it is a mobile chat application where you can
//! match with other peoples from around the world based on your interests.
//! you can read more about Owlchat here at [Owlchat Whitepaper draft](#todo).
//!
//! Owlchat is a privacy-focused metadata-free end-to-end encrypted chat application (a lot of hyphens here :D)
//! but anyway .. into the point, Owlchat needed a Points/Coins system, where a user uses these points
//! to do a match with another person (1 Coin = 1 Match), and these Coins can be purchased
//! using in-app payment systems, like say Google Pay or Apple Pay!
//!
//! Next, after deploying the contract on a smart contract chain like `Edgeware`,
//! when a user purchases these coins the system will send a TX to the smart contract with
//! the account public key and the amount of the coins.
//!
//! And whenever the user wants to do a Match, the server simply does a simple check to query the smart contract
//! with a fee-less RPC to the chain, and if the user have coins, the server can run the matching algorithm!
//! Yes, it is that simple!
//!
//! ### Ownership
//!
//! The account that will deploy the contract will gain ownership access
//! over anything that requires mutations.
//!
//! ### Open Questions ðŸ¤”
//!
//! 1. Currently, any TXs require the smart-contract owner to have a balance to execute the transaction.
//! how do we do the transaction efficiently to lower any fees?
//! since with every user do a match we do a TX!
//!
//! 2. How to secure the smart-contract owner account private key on a server environment? hardware-wallets?
//!
//! If you have any improvements or questions, please feel free to chat with me or open a new issue will be very welcome!
//!
//! For Internal Implementation: see the [`koins`](crate::koins) module.
